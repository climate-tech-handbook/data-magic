Costa's climate journey and how public transportation projects motivated him to focus on climate change and decarbonizationThe big questions he wanted answered as a civil engineerThe three buckets that Costa focuses on: Resiliency, Automation, and The Energy TransitionThe link between Costa's research and policyAs a researcher, how Costa assesses trade-offs when looking at the best climate solutionsHow to move forward on climate solutions with the many conflicting interests and opinions around the worldWhat individuals can do to accelerate climate solutions and why voluntary action alone won't solve climate changeA discussion on bandaid climate solutions and individual action being the focus of reducing carbon emissions rather than systems changesWhy local policy and community work is important in affecting climate changeA zero-carbon electricity system and why Costa believes this will most accelerate the clean energy transitionPolicies Costa would put in place that would dramatically affect climate changeWhy research and development play a key role in accelerating climate solutions
