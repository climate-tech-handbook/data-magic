Back by popular demand, today's guest is Nathaniel Stinnett, Founder and Executive Director of the Environmental Voter Project, a non-profit that aims to significantly increase voter demand for environmental leadership by identifying inactive environmentalists and then turning them into consistent activists and voters. 
Nathaniel explains the Environmental Voter Project's work, how they identify environmental non-voters, and what they do to get them to the polls. He also explains WHY it is so important to get them to the polls, and what the EVP theory of change is. And finally, he fills me in on the general election, the Georgia runoffs, the state of our democracy, and some of EVPs most recent results. I learn tons every time I speak with Nathaniel, and it was great to have him back on the show!
