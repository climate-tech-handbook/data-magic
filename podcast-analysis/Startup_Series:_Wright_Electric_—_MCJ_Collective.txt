Today’s guest is Jeff Engler, Founder and CEO of Wright Electric. 
Wright Electric is accelerating the transition to zero-emission aviation by building the world's largest electric airplanes. The Wright 1 is a single-aisle aircraft with an 800-mile range and can hold up to 186 passengers. Wright Electric redesigns airplanes to be more efficient by creating effective motors, aerodynamic fuselage, and lightweight energy storage systems. Its planes also have lower fuel costs, noise, emissions, and runway takeoff time. Wright Electric is working to provide green solutions airlines are looking for. Backed by a grant from Massachusetts and the Y Combinator Accelerator program, Wright is transforming aviation. 
Jeff Engler, takes me through his path to zero-emission aviation, why he started Wright Electric, and how the landscape has changed. We also discuss the many critics of electric airplanes, what sets Wright Electric apart, and the industry's future. Jeff and his team are tackling one of climate change's biggest problems. It was great to have him on the show!Enjoy the show!
