## Overview

The development of distributed energy storage is a key element in reversing climate change. Through the use of distributed energy storage, energy can be stored locally and used when needed, reducing the need for large, centralized power plants that emit greenhouse gases.

One example of a breakthrough technology in distributed energy storage is the development of lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are much more efficient than traditional lead-acid batteries, and can be used to store large amounts of energy. This technology has been used in a variety of applications, including electric vehicles and home energy storage systems.

Several companies and organizations have been at the forefront of developing distributed energy storage solutions. Tesla is one company that has developed a home battery system, called the Powerwall, which uses lithium-ion batteries. Another company, SunPower, has developed a solar panel system that includes a built-in lithium-ion battery. These and other companies are helping to make distributed energy storage a reality.

## Progress Made

The development of distributed energy storage has made great progress in reversing climate change. Some examples of breakthrough technologies that have been developed include:
* Solar PV panels: Solar PV panels have been developed that are much more efficient than traditional solar panels. This has led to a significant reduction in the cost of solar power, making it more accessible to more people.
* Wind turbines: Wind turbines have been developed that are much more efficient than traditional wind turbines. This has led to a significant reduction in the cost of wind power, making it more accessible to more people.
* Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles have been developed that are much more efficient than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. This has led to a significant reduction in the emissions from transportation, making it a more sustainable option for transportation.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include:
* Tesla: Tesla has been a leader in the development of electric vehicles, solar PV panels, and battery storage.
* SunPower: SunPower has been a leader in the development of solar PV panels and solar power systems.
* Vestas: Vestas has been a leader in the development of wind turbines.

## Lessons Learned

One of the key lessons learned in the development and implementation of distributed energy storage is the importance of siting and sizing the technology appropriately. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, "properly sited and sized DER systems can provide numerous benefits to the electric grid, including improved power quality, voltage support, grid stability, and resilience." However, if the technology is not properly sited or sized, it can actually have negative impacts on the grid, including decreased power quality, voltage instability, and increased grid congestion.

Another key lesson is the importance of integrating distributed energy storage into the grid in a way that is compatible with existing infrastructure. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, "successful integration of DER into the grid requires a number of technical, economic, and policy considerations, including grid connection, grid operations, market design, and public acceptance."

Finally, it is important to consider the full range of benefits and costs associated with distributed energy storage. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, benefits of distributed energy storage include " improved power quality and reliability, voltage support, grid stability, and resilience; reduced line losses; and avoided or deferred transmission and distribution upgrades." However, costs associated with distributed energy storage include "capital costs, O&M costs, and, in some cases, integration costs."

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Distributed Energy Storage to reverse climate change are:

1. The high cost of storage technology. Storage technology is still relatively new and expensive, making it difficult to scale up and widely adopt.

2. The lack of a comprehensive storage plan. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to energy storage, so a comprehensive plan is needed to ensure that the right technology is used in the right place.

3. The need for more research and development. Storage technology is constantly evolving, so more research and development is needed to improve its performance and reduce costs.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution are:

1. Tesla Motors: Tesla is a leading manufacturer of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

2. Enel Green Power: Enel is a leading developer of renewable energy projects.

3. SunPower: SunPower is a leading manufacturer of solar panels and solar energy systems.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of distributed energy storage to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and to make it more affordable. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of distributed energy storage

2. Incentivizing the adoption of distributed energy storage through government policies and regulations

3. Supporting the development of new business models for distributed energy storage

4. Investing in research and development to improve the technology

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include Tesla, SunPower, and First Solar. Progress made in this area includes the development of new storage technologies, the deployment of storage systems at scale, and the creation of new business models for storage.
