## Overview

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a set of principles and practices that can dramatically increase the productivity of irrigated rice systems while saving water, labor, and other inputs. It was developed in the 1980s by the French Jesuit priest Henri de Laulanié in Madagascar and has since been adopted in more than 50 countries.

SRI principles and practices include:

• Transplanting young seedlings (instead of broadcasting seeds)

• Space plants wider apart (to reduce competition for light, water, and nutrients)

• Use organic inputs (such as compost or green manure) to improve soil health

• Apply water judiciously (to avoid waterlogging and leaching of nutrients)

• Control weeds mechanically (to reduce the need for herbicides)

The adoption of SRI principles and practices can result in significant increases in yields (up to 50 percent or more in some cases) while reducing water use by 20-40 percent. In addition, SRI farmers typically use less fertilizer and fewer pesticides, and they incur lower production costs.

The widespread adoption of SRI principles and practices could have a major impact on greenhouse gas emissions from the rice sector. For example, a 20 percent increase in global rice yields (achievable with SRI) would reduce methane emissions from rice paddies by 12.5 million metric tons – equivalent to the annual emissions of about 25 million passenger vehicles.

Several companies and organizations are at the forefront of promoting SRI, including the SRI International Network and Resources Center (SRI-Rice), the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

## Progress Made

The progress that has been made in developing System of Rice Intensification to reverse climate change is significant. New technologies have been developed that have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies include:

1. Improved irrigation systems that use less water and are more efficient.

2. Improved seeds that are more resistant to pests and diseases.

3. Improved fertilizer application methods that reduce wastage and leaching.

4. Improved crop management practices that optimize growth and yield.

Organizations such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the World Bank have been at the forefront of promoting and supporting the adoption of SRI practices. In recent years, many companies and farmers have started to adopt SRI practices, and the results have been very positive. SRI has been shown to increase yield, reduce water use, and improve soil health. These benefits have all contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of System of Rice Intensification to reverse climate change are as follows:

1. It is important to carry out research and development activities to improve the productivity and efficiency of the technology.

2. It is necessary to engage stakeholders in the process of developing and implementing the technology.

3. There should be a clear and consistent policy framework to guide the development and implementation of the technology.

4. The technology should be made accessible to small-scale farmers.

5. The technology should be affordable for small-scale farmers.

6. The technology should be easy to use and understand.

## Challenges Ahead

The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) to reverse climate change are:

1. Lack of awareness: There is still lack of awareness about SRI among farmers, extension workers and policy-makers. There is a need to create more awareness about the potential of SRI in reversing climate change.

2. Lack of technical knowledge and skills: Many farmers and extension workers do not have the technical knowledge and skills required for implementing SRI. There is a need to provide more training and support to these groups.

3. Lack of financial resources: Many farmers do not have the financial resources required for adopting SRI. There is a need to provide more financial support to farmers for adopting SRI.

4. Lack of infrastructure: There is still lack of infrastructure for supporting SRI adoption, such as irrigation facilities, storage facilities and processing facilities. There is a need to improve infrastructure for supporting SRI adoption.

5. Socio-cultural barriers: There are still some socio-cultural barriers that prevent farmers from adopting SRI, such as beliefs and customs. There is a need to create more awareness about the potential of SRI in reversing climate change and to address these socio-cultural barriers.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of System of Rice Intensification to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to ensure that it is adopted on a large scale and is effective. Steps that need to be taken to ensure this include:

1. Increasing awareness of System of Rice Intensification and its benefits among rice farmers and other stakeholders.

2. Conducting more research to further develop and refine the technology.

3. Supporting and promoting the adoption of System of Rice Intensification by providing training, extension services, and financial incentives.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), the System of Rice Intensification Network (SRI-Rice), and the Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE).
