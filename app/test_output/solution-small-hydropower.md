## Overview

The development of small hydropower has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a number of ways. One example is the use of micro-hydro turbines, which are much more efficient than traditional turbines and can be used in a variety of settings, including in remote villages where grid power is not available. Other examples include the use of hydropower to pump water for irrigation and to generate electricity, both of which can reduce the need for fossil fuels.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing small hydropower include the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank.

## Progress Made

Progress has been made in developing Small Hydropower to reverse climate change through the development of breakthrough technologies. One such technology is the development of small hydropower plants that can be used to generate electricity. These plants can be used to generate electricity from the water flowing through them, and this electricity can be used to power homes and businesses. This technology has contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by providing a cleaner source of electricity. Other companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Small Hydropower to reverse climate change are as follows:

1. Small hydropower can be an important source of renewable energy, contributing to the fight against climate change.

2. Small hydropower can be cost-effective, with levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) often competitive with other renewable energy technologies.

3. Small hydropower can provide grid stability and flexibility, helping to integrating larger shares of renewable energy onto the grid.

4. Small hydropower development can sometimes be controversial, with concerns about impacts on the environment, local communities, and indigenous peoples. Careful planning and engagement with all stakeholders is essential to ensuring successful projects.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of small hydropower development include the International hydropower Association (IHA), the Small Hydropower Association (SHPA), and various national and regional hydropower associations.

## Challenges Ahead

Though small hydropower presents a renewable and efficient solution to climate change, a number of challenges remain in its development and implementation. First, the cost of small hydropower plants can be prohibitive, especially in developing countries. Second, the technology is still relatively new and thus faces significant technical challenges. Finally, small hydropower plants can have negative environmental impacts, such as altering local hydrology and causing habitat loss.

One way to overcome the cost barrier is through public-private partnerships. The World Bank, for example, has been working with governments and the private sector to develop small hydropower plants in a number of countries, including Nepal, Pakistan, and Vietnam. In addition, a number of companies have been working to develop more affordable small hydropower technologies. One such company is the Swiss firm Blue Energy, which has developed a small hydropower plant that can be installed for less than $1,000.

The technical challenges facing small hydropower are being addressed by a number of research and development initiatives. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is working to promote the use of small hydropower through research and capacity building. In addition, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is supporting the development of small hydropower in developing countries through its Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative.

Despite the potential benefits of small hydropower, it is important to consider the potential environmental impacts of this technology. Small hydropower plants can cause alterations to local hydrology and lead to habitat loss. In addition, the construction of small hydropower plants can result in the displacement of local communities. To minimize these impacts, it is important to carefully assess the potential environmental impacts of small hydropower plants before their construction.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Small Hydropower to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to develop the technology and make it more accessible to people. Steps that need to be taken to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include: 

1. Increasing awareness of small hydropower and its potential benefits.

2. Making small hydropower more affordable and accessible.

3. Improving the efficiency of small hydropower systems.

4. Supporting research and development of small hydropower technologies.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of developing and promoting small hydropower include the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank.
