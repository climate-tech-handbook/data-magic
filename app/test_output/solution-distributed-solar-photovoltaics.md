## Progress Made

The development of Distributed Solar Photovoltaics (DSPV) to reverse climate change has seen significant progress in recent years. Breakthrough technologies such as thin-film PV, multi-junction PV cells, and concentrator PV have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by allowing for the more efficient conversion of sunlight into electricity. Companies and organizations such as First Solar, SunPower, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have been at the forefront of this solution, developing innovative technologies and working to reduce the cost of PV systems.

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Distributed Solar Photovoltaics to reverse climate change are as follows: 

1. It is important to have a clear and attainable goal when implementing a new technology, such as Distributed Solar Photovoltaics. Having a well-defined goal will help to ensure that the technology is deployed in an efficient and effective manner.

2. It is also important to have a clear understanding of the potential benefits and drawbacks of the technology before implementing it. This will help to ensure that the technology is used in the most appropriate way possible.

3. It is important to involve all stakeholders in the development and implementation of the technology. This will help to ensure that the technology is deployed in a way that is acceptable to all parties involved.

4. It is important to monitor and evaluate the performance of the technology after it has been deployed. This will help to ensure that the technology is functioning as intended and that any problems are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

## Challenges Ahead

The development and implementation of distributed solar photovoltaics (DSPV) has been hindered by several major challenges. One obstacle is the high upfront cost of installing PV systems, which can be a barrier to adoption, particularly for low- and middle-income households. In addition, the intermittency of solar PV output can pose challenges to grid operators, who must manage the variability of renewable energy sources. Another challenge is the "duck curve" phenomenon, which occurs when high levels of solar PV output during the daytime coincide with low demand for electricity, leading to negative prices and reduced profitability for solar PV generators.

Despite these challenges, DSPV has been gaining momentum in recent years. The cost of PV systems has fallen dramatically, making them more affordable for households and businesses. In addition, new technologies and business models are helping to address the intermittency issue, such as energy storage and demand response. And, the duck curve can be mitigated through a variety of measures, such as increasing the flexibility of the power system.

There are a number of companies and organizations that are at the forefront of DSPV deployment. In the United States, for example, SolarCity and SunPower are two of the leading installers of rooftop PV systems. And a number of utilities, such as Xcel Energy and Southern Company, have been active in developing and deploying community solar programs.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of distributed solar photovoltaics to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and make it more affordable. In addition, policies and incentives need to be put in place to encourage homeowners and businesses to install solar panels.

Solar panels have been getting more efficient and cheaper over the last few years, but there is still room for improvement. Research and development should continue in order to make solar panels even more efficient and less expensive.

Policies and incentives are important to encourage people to install solar panels. Some examples of policies and incentives include net metering, which allows people who generate their own electricity with solar panels to sell any excess electricity back to the grid, and solar renewable energy credits, which are credits that solar panel owners can sell to utilities in order to meet renewable energy goals.

There are many companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of the solar PV movement. Some examples include SolarCity, SunPower, and the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Solar PV is a promising technology that has the potential to help mitigate climate change. However, it is important to continue to invest in research and development to improve the technology and make it more affordable. In addition, policies and incentives need to be put in place to encourage homeowners and businesses to install solar panels.
