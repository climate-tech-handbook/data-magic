## Overview

In the United States, the EPAâ€™s Agricultural Waste Management Field Handbook (AWMFH) provides a comprehensive guide to manure management that includes information on the benefits of manure management, the types of manure management systems available, and how to design and operate a manure management system. The AWMFH also includes a section on manure nutrients and their value, as well as a section on manure and greenhouse gas emissions.

Over the past few years, there have been a number of breakthrough technologies that have been developed to improve manure management and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies include:

- Anaerobic Digestion: This is a process that breaks down organic matter in the absence of oxygen to produce methane-rich biogas. The biogas can then be used to generate electricity or heat, or it can be converted into transportation fuels.

- Covered Lagoon: This is a type of manure management system that uses a cover to reduce evaporation and methane emissions.

- Nutrient Management Planning: This is a process of developing a plan to optimize the use of manure nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, while minimizing the potential for environmental impacts.

- Phosphorus Recovery: This is a process of recovering phosphorus from manure and using it as a fertilizer, rather than letting it runoff into surface water bodies where it can cause environmental problems.

- Manure Injection: This is a process of injecting manure below the soil surface, rather than spreading it on the surface, to reduce evaporation and methane emissions.

- Manure Separation: This is a process of separating solid and liquid manure, which allows for more efficient storage, handling, and use of manure.

A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of developing and promoting these technologies, including the EPA, the USDA, the National Pork Board, and the Environmental Defense Fund.

## Progress Made

Some progress has been made in developing Improved Manure Management to reverse climate change. Examples of breakthrough technologies that have been developed include:

- Anaerobic digestion: This technology breaks down manure in the absence of oxygen, which reduces methane emissions.

- Covered lagoons: This technology covers manure storage lagoons to capture methane emissions.

- Improved manure application: This technology improves the way manure is applied to crops, which reduces methane emissions.

These technologies have contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include:

- United States Environmental Protection Agency

- United States Department of Agriculture

- National Renewable Energy Laboratory

## Lessons Learned

Some key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to reverse climate change include the importance of manure management in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the need for improved manure management practices to be economically viable, and the need for manure management practices to be socially acceptable.

Manure management is a critical component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Manure management can include manure storage, manure handling, manure application, and manure composting. Each of these practices can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Improved manure management practices must be economically viable in order to be adopted by farmers. In order for manure management practices to be economically viable, they must be able to save farmers money or generate revenue. For example, manure storage practices can save farmers money by reducing the need for bedding material, and manure application practices can generate revenue by selling manure as a fertilizer.

Improved manure management practices must also be socially acceptable in order to be adopted by farmers. In order for manure management practices to be socially acceptable, they must not create nuisances for neighboring properties, must not create health risks for farm workers or the general public, and must not create environmental problems.

## Challenges Ahead

1. The challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to reverse climate change are:

a. The need to develop and implement improved manure management practices on a larger scale.

b. The need to overcome obstacles to the widespread adoption of this technology.

2. The obstacles that need to be overcome to scale up and widely adopt this technology are:

a. The need to educate farmers and other stakeholders on the benefits of improved manure management.

b. The need to invest in infrastructure and training to support the widespread adoption of this technology.

3. The companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution are:

a. The United States Environmental Protection Agency

b. The United States Department of Agriculture

c. The Natural Resources Conservation Service

4. The progress that has been made in this area to help understand these lessons is:

a. The development of improved manure management practices.

b. The implementation of these practices on a larger scale.

c. The education of farmers and other stakeholders on the benefits of improved manure management.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Improved Manure Management to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to first invest in research and development of the technology. This can be done through public-private partnerships, government grants, and other forms of funding. Once the technology is developed, it needs to be implemented on a large scale. This can be done through government incentives, regulations, and education campaigns.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution are the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Progress has been made in this area through the development of new technology, the implementation of voluntary programs, and the passage of legislation.
