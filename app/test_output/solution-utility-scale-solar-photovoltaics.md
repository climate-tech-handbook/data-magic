## Overview

Solar photovoltaics (PV) are an important part of the fight against climate change. PV technology converts sunlight into electricity, and can be used on a small scale (like in solar-powered calculators) or on a large scale to power homes and businesses. Utility-scale solar PV is a rapidly growing industry, with the capacity to generate gigawatts (GW) of electricity.

In the United States, utility-scale solar PV capacity has grown from less than 1 GW in 2009 to over 20 GW in 2018. This growth is driven by declining costs, state and federal incentives, and the increasing availability of financing. The cost of solar PV has fallen by more than 70% since 2009, making it one of the fastest-growing sources of new electricity generation in the United States.

Solar PV is not the only technology that is helping to reverse climate change. Other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar thermal (concentrating solar power) are also playing a role. But solar PV is unique in its ability to be used on a small scale (like in solar-powered calculators) or on a large scale to power homes and businesses.

One company that has been at the forefront of the solar PV industry is First Solar. First Solar is a leading manufacturer of solar PV panels and provide solar PV systems for utility, commercial, and residential customers.

## Progress Made

A number of different Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technologies have been developed in recent years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reverse climate change. Some of the most notable breakthrough technologies include thin-film solar cells, solar concentrators, and solar thermal energy storage.

Thin-film solar cells are made from a variety of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). These cells are much thinner than traditional crystalline silicon solar cells and can be produced on a variety of substrates, including glass, metal, and plastic. Thin-film solar cells are less efficient than crystalline silicon solar cells, but they are cheaper to produce and can be used in a wider range of applications.

Solar concentrators are devices that focus sunlight onto a small area to increase the amount of light that can be converted into electricity. Concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) systems use solar concentrators to increase the efficiency of solar cells. Solar thermal systems use solar concentrators to heat a fluid, which can then be used to generate electricity or to provide space heating and cooling.

Solar thermal energy storage systems store solar energy in the form of heat. This heat can then be used to generate electricity or to provide space heating and cooling. Solar thermal energy storage systems are typically used in conjunction with solar thermal power plants, which use mirrors to focus sunlight onto a fluid, which is then used to generate electricity.

A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of developing Utility-Scale Solar PV technologies, including First Solar, SunPower, and the U.S. Department of Energy. These organizations have made significant progress in developing and commercializing these technologies, which are now being used around the world to generate electricity and to provide space heating and cooling.

## Lessons Learned

Utility-scale solar photovoltaics (USPV) is a technology that has been developed in order to reverse climate change. USPV systems are designed to produce electricity on a large scale, making them a potential solution to climate change. There are a number of lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of USPV systems.

One lesson that has been learned is that USPV systems are expensive to install and maintain. The cost of USPV systems has been a barrier to their widespread adoption. Another lesson that has been learned is that USPV systems require a lot of land to be effective. This has led to conflicts with landowners and other stakeholders.

Despite these challenges, USPV systems have been successful in a number of applications. They have been used to power homes, businesses, and even entire communities. USPV systems have also been used to offset the emissions of traditional power plants.

There are a number of companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of USPV development and implementation. These include SunPower, First Solar, and the U.S. Department of Energy.

The lessons learned in the development and implementation of USPV systems can help us to improve the technology and make it more widely available. These lessons can also help us to avoid the mistakes that have been made in the past.

## Challenges Ahead

The major challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics to reverse climate change are the high cost of solar panels, the lack of storage capacity for solar power, and the need for more efficient solar cells.

Solar panels are currently the most expensive option for generating electricity, with the cost of solar panels falling only slowly over time. In order to make solar power more economically viable, the cost of solar panels needs to be reduced by more than half. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as increasing the efficiency of solar cells, developing new manufacturing methods, or finding cheaper materials.

Another challenge facing solar power is the lack of storage capacity. Solar power is intermittent, meaning that it is only available when the sun is shining. This makes it difficult to use solar power on a large scale, as there needs to be a way to store the power for use when the sun is not shining. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as using batteries, using hydrogen fuel cells, or using pumped storage.

Finally, solar cells need to be more efficient in order to make solar power more viable. Solar cells currently only convert a small percentage of the sunlight that hits them into electricity. If solar cells could be made more efficient, they would be able to generate more electricity from the same amount of sunlight, making solar power more economically viable.

## Best Path Forward

The best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaics to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change is to continue to research and develop the technology so that it can be adopted on a large scale. The technology needs to be made more affordable and accessible to people in order to be effective. Companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution include SunPower, First Solar, and SunEdison.
